Create To-Do items and what properties they should have

To-Do list should have projects 

THE PLAN!!!:
uhh check previous projects that you frogot since its been months build onto that

plan B:
keep getting lost lmao go figure things out
you should believe!!!

progress in order:

Finished Create Project Button utilizing addprojectotprojectarr
Finished Create To Do button creating todos using the todo factory method
Finished Selecting Projects and showing the todos based on it
Finished Remove Project and Todos Functionality

TODO:
High: When these are done it can now be submitted
Improve Styles and make it look like a website app todolist
use date-fns functions 
improve the todo functionality and display

these between medium and low can be implemented on free time for the cs50 PROJECT pass basically qol updates
Low
possibly a checklist function for todos
setting that can delete all finished todos 

ideas:
ipad click app switch tab dynamically display more details on todo

Reflection:
After doing a bit of crazy stuff in utilizing classes i went crazy and just did factory functions instead lol. I decided that displayToDos would depend on DisplayProject kinda
so when u click a certain project it will get that certain todos within that project index using the todo.js functions usually yea todos depend on project but i think theres some code in
todo that project requires so its kind of like tightly coupled which is bad coding design but thats fine. IT also full of spaghetti code but its my spaghetti code i can navigate it but if i stopped working on it
ill probably get lost lol. SO far just abit more polishing and design and i think its noiw good.

How do i implement colors on squares:
    bASED ON the priority we should dynamically allocate a class with its corresponding color so css the three colors maybe each with diffrent class for example
    sqaure.red square.yellow square.green it should also probably be sorted from easiest to highest as well at some point.

- steps to gh pages update npx webpack serve, git add dist, git commit -m  "Deployment commit", git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
- take note try refactoring the dom manipulation js and take notes about the structure of the code first before adding right now we need to fi
fix rather than add functionalities first
future notes prob njot uysed 

//function that called to show and append all projects for the new project made to show in the dom
      //showProjects();
      //creates a query that makes sure if yes or no to delete the project if it contains todolists maybe
      //const makeSureHandler = () => {
        
      //}

FINAL ONE THEN I CAN SUBMIT MAYBE A BIT MORE POLISHING AFTERWARDS
Implementing A checkList Function 

why implement it: its cool to have steps to finish it by setting them maybe i shouldnt make just three and just make a class or factory function that creates them 
and make the div inside it overflow auto so that when user creates a bunch of these it dont overflow. text deco linethrough to make checklsit done when checkbox clicked.

how to implement? dunno create factory function have the todo have an array that stores these todos so for each todo theres an checklistarray but idk if logic is correct 
like will it not work because of projectInstance having to do arr this thing confusing. ill figure it ouit when i implement.

features/ functions:
Create a checkbox
edit a checkbox
toggle a checkBox
delete a checkbox

finish It button is only clickable once all checkboxes in the cbecklist Array are toggle to a true state / have the line through class or sum. yes

plan in motion:
it works now so i can create checklists and remove them albeit jsuit text and just an input added a new parameter "Done" that is true or false

current problems, when i call checkListFunc it seems the checkListInstance gets depreceated when leaving the specific to do probably cause of losing the to do index
but this will be noted which means i cannot create or delete the checkList array within the todo cause it returns undefined
